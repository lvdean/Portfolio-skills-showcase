# Portfolio page 

## Description

This weeks challenge was to create a webpage from sctratch displays a portfolio. The purpose of the portfolio is to showcase your skills and talents in preparation for a succesful career search. The aim is to apply the core skills recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

## Completed Issues

* Create a portfolio with name a recent photo or avatar, and links to 'about me' section, work, and contact.
* Navigation links scroll to corresponding section.
* 'My Work' section scrolls to a section with titled images of the applications.
* The first application's image should be larger in size than the others.
* Clicking on the applications will direct to live application.
* Creating a responsive layout that adapts to viewport.


### Reflection of tasks

This provided an excellent opportunity to hone and expand upon the fundamental skills acquired thus far, while exploring new coding techniques. It also allowed me to unleash my creativity. I faced challenges in properly labeling applications and ensuring responsive design as screen sizes varied.
